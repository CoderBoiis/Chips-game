This is for anyone I know who wants to do coding wit me. If you know me mostly too. Just tell me in teams(if you are my classmate) and tell me in an issue here in github(if you are a repl.it user).

What you see is a series of files and folders with a little code in them. If you know C++ or Python, and you know the creator of this repository in person, you may edit it. 
(that's what he told me, at least :P)
