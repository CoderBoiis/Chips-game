This is for anyone I know who wants to do coding wit me. If you know me mostly too. Just tell me in teams(if you are my classmate) and tell me in an issue here in github(if you are a repl.it user).

What you see is a series of files and folders with a little code in them. If you know C++ or Python, and you know the creator of this repository in person, you may edit it. 
(that's what he told me, at least :P)

Hi guys.Im new

## *Project-Working Right Now*
The project we are working on currently is the chips.py file which is on a game called chips. This is a game where two or more people play. They take up to half the chips in the pile(up to 100) per turn. Whoever takes the last chip loses. Check chips.cpp(which was made using a LinkedIn tutorial on C++) for how to create the game. Do the code for this project in the chips branch.
