## *This Repo's Project*
The project we are working on currently is the chips.py file which is on a game called chips. This is a game where two or more people play. They take up to half the chips in the pile(up to 100) per turn. Whoever takes the last chip loses. Check chips.cpp for how to create the game. That was made using the LinkedIn tutorial on C++.

What you see is a series of files and folders with a little code in them. If you know C++ or Python, and you know the creator of this repository in person, you may edit it. 
(that's what he told me, at least :P)
